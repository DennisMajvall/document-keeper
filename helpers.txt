To make a column auto_increment:
  GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY(START WITH 1, INCREMENT BY 1)

To make a column unique:
CONSTRAINT SOME_NAME_HERE UNIQUE (COL_NAME);

Example:
create table "ROOT".FILES
(
  ID INTEGER not null primary key GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY(START WITH 1, INCREMENT BY 1),
  NAME VARCHAR(128) not null,
  CHECKSUM BIGINT not null,
  CONSTRAINT unique_checksum UNIQUE (CHECKSUM)
)
